EZ-RASSOR
----
The EZ-RASSOR (Easy Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot) is an inexpensive, autonomous, regolith-mining robot designed to mimic the look and functionality of NASAâ€™s RASSOR on a smaller scale. The primary goal of the EZ-RASSOR is to provide a functional demonstration of the RASSOR for visitors at the Kennedy Space Center. The EZ-RASSOR can:

- Rove across light-to-moderate terrain
- Collect regolith in rotating drums
- Execute pre-planned routines
- Return regolith to hoppers located away from dig sites
- Autonomously navigate around possible obstructions
- Cooperate in a swarm of other EZ-RASSORs

This repository contains all of the code for the EZ-RASSOR, its simulations, control apps, and its RC demonstration car called the EZRC.

DEVELOPMENT
----
This repository contains a script, `ezrassor.sh`, that makes improving this software easier and more straightforward for developers. It is run using this command:
::
  bash ezrassor.sh [--flag] [args]
