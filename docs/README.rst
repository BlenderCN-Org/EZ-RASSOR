EZ-RASSOR
---------
The EZ-RASSOR (EZ Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot) is an inexpensive, autonomous, regolith-mining robot designed to mimic the look and abilities of NASAâ€™s RASSOR on a smaller scale. The primary goal of the EZ-RASSOR is to provide a demonstration robot for visitors at the Kennedy Space Center. The EZ-RASSOR can:

- Rove across light-to-moderate terrain
- Collect regolith in rotating drums
- Return regolith to hoppers located away from dig sites
- Execute pre-planned routines
- Autonomously navigate around possible obstructions
- Cooperate in a swarm of other EZ-RASSORs

This repository contains all of the code for the EZ-RASSOR as well as supporting documentation.
