EZ-RASSOR
---------
The EZ-RASSOR (EZ Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot) is an inexpensive, autonomous, regolith-mining robot designed to mimic the look and abilities of NASAâ€™s RASSOR on a smaller scale. The primary goal of the EZ-RASSOR is to provide a demonstration robot for visitors at the Kennedy Space Center. The EZ-RASSOR can:

- Rove across light-to-moderate terrain
- Collect regolith in rotating drums
- Return regolith to hoppers located away from dig sites
- Execute pre-planned routines
- Autonomously navigate around possible obstructions
- Cooperate in a swarm of other EZ-RASSORs

This repository contains all of the code for the EZ-RASSOR as well as supporting documentation.

INSTALLATION
------------
Clone this repository with ``git`` to begin the installation process. You must use the ``--recursive`` flag when you clone with ``git``. This tells ``git`` to also clone submodules that this project relies on.
::
  git clone https://github.com/FlaSpaceInst/NASA-E-RASSOR-Team.git --recursive
  cd NASA-E-RASSOR-Team

Next, let the ``install.sh`` script do the heavy lifting. This script's general syntax looks like this:
::
  sh install.sh <software> [arguments...]
  
It is able to install all of the following:

``ros``
  Install the ROS suite of software. This software is required to operate the EZ-RASSOR (and must be installed first). This script will automatically install ROS for Ubuntu Xenial and Ubuntu Bionic. For all other systems, check out these `wiki pages`_ to install ROS manually. After installing ROS with this script, **you must restart your terminal before proceeding**.
``tools``
  Install some ROS build tools that are required to build the EZ-RASSOR core packages. Again, this suite of software can only be installed automatically on Ubuntu Xenial and Ubuntu Bionic. For all other systems, check out this `wiki section`_ to install the build tools manually.
``packages [-e, --except <packages...> | -o, --only <packages...>]``
  Install core EZ-RASSOR packages. After installing these packages, **you must restart your terminal for changes to take effect**. Ignore specific packages with the ``-e`` or ``--except`` flag. Install specific packages with the ``-o`` or ``--only`` flag.

Here are some example installations:
::
  # Installing on Ubuntu Xenial with all EZ-RASSOR packages.
  git clone https://github.com/FlaSpaceInst/NASA-E-RASSOR-Team.git --recursive
  cd NASA-E-RASSOR-Team
  sh install.sh ros
  ** RESTART TERMINAL **
  sh install.sh tools
  sh install.sh packages
  ** RESTART TERMINAL **
  
  # Installing on Ubuntu Bionic without the ezrassor_autonomous_control package.
  git clone https://github.com/FlaSpaceInst/NASA-E-RASSOR-Team.git --recursive
  cd NASA-E-RASSOR-Team
  sh install.sh ros
  ** RESTART TERMINAL **
  sh install.sh tools
  sh install.sh packages --except ezrassor_autonomous_control
  ** RESTART TERMINAL **
  
  # Installing on Raspbian Jessie without any simulation packages.
  git clone https://github.com/FlaSpaceInst/NASA-E-RASSOR-Team.git --recursive
  cd NASA-E-RASSOR-Team
  ** INSTALL ROS AND BUILD TOOLS SEPARATELY **
  sh install.sh packages --except ezrassor_sim_control ezrassor_sim_description ezrassor_sim_gazebo
  ** RESTART TERMINAL **
